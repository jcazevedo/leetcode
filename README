                         Solutions to LeetCode problems

Instructions
------------

The source code doesn't actually compile by itself. In each file is a single
class or the correct method implemented as needed by the LeetCode judge. If you
want to try things out, you can either create your own main function and invoke
the implemented methods or experiment in the online judge.

I try to name the filenames according to the problem names, so that they are
easily identifiable.
