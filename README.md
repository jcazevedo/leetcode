# Solutions for LeetCode problems

This directory contains my solutions for [LeetCode][leetcode] problems. These
solutions are provided "as is". I give no guarantees that they will work as
expected. Please refrain from using my solutions in the site.

## Instructions

LeetCode problems are solved by implementing a method of a given class. Each
file under the `src/` category contains the implementation of the required
class. As such, these aren't runnable on their own. To run these, either resort
to LeetCode's platform or create a main method that contains calls to the
implemented methods.

I try to name the filenames according to the problem names, so that they are
easily identifiable.
